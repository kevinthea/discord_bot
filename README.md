# discord_bot
This is a discord bot with more functionality being added over time

https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html

Things I would like to eventually add:

. music integration

. minecraft white list, something like... "-whitelist _username_"


======================================================================
You will need a .env file with contents similar to:

# .env
DISCORD_TOKEN=_discord token_

DISCORD_GUILD=_discord server name_

DISCORD_CHANNEL=_id of the channel the bot will post to_
