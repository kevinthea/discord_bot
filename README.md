======================================================================

Things I would like to eventually add:

. music integration

. minecraft white list, something like... "-whitelist _username_"


======================================================================

You will need a .env file with contents similar to:

```
# .env
DISCORD_TOKEN = <discord token>
DISCORD_GUILD = <discord server name>
DISCORD_CHANNEL = <id of the channel the bot will post to>
```
