# discord_bot
This is a discord bot with more functionality being added over time

https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html

======================================================================

Things I would like to eventually add:

. music integration

. minecraft white list, something like... "-whitelist _username_"


======================================================================

You will need a .env file with contents similar to:

```
# .env
DISCORD_TOKEN=<discord token>
DISCORD_GUILD=<discord server name>
DISCORD_CHANNEL=<id of the channel the bot will post to>
```
